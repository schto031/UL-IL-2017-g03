\subsection{Operation Model for oeSetCoordinatorExpertise}

\label{OM-oeSetCoordinatorExpertise}


The \msrcode{oeSetCoordinatorExpertise} operation has the following properties:

	\begin{operationmodel}
	\addheading{Operation}
	\adddoublerow{oeSetCoordinatorExpertise}{with this operation a new association is either build or deleted between a coordinator instance and an expertise field 
	 }

	\addrowheading{Parameters}
	\addnumbereddoublerow{}{AdtExpertise: etExpertise}{enumeration of possible expertises} 
	\addnumbereddoublerow{}{AdtAddOrDelete: dtAddOrDelete}{boolean true if add and false if delete} 
	\addnumbereddoublerow{}{AdtCoordinatorID: dtCoordinatorID}{serves the identification of an coordinator} 

	\addrowheading{Return type}
	\addsinglerow{ptBoolean}

	\addrowheading{Pre-Condition (protocol)}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PreP}{the system is started}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PreP}{the actor logged previously and did not log out ! (i.e. the associated ctCoordinator instance is considered logged)}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PreP}{if the addordelete variable is false the has to be a matching association}
		
	\addrowheading{Pre-Condition (functional)}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PreF}{an instance of a coordinator with this CoordinatorID parameter exists}

	\addrowheading{Post-Condition (functional)}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PostF}{If the addordelete variable is true and there is no instance of the expertise linked to the coordinator already existent a new instance is created and linked to this coordinator}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PostF}{If the addordelete variable is false and if there exists an instance of that expertise linked to this coordinator this existing linked expertise is deleted}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PostF}{If the addordelete variable is false and if there doesn't exists an instance of that expertise linked to this coordinator an error message is send to the actor 
	indicating that the expertise he intended to delete doesn't exist for this coordinator}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PostF}{If the addordelete variable is true and there is instance of the expertise linked to the coordinator already existent an error message is send to the actor
	indicating that the expertise he intended to link to the coordinator already exists for this coordinator}

	\addrowheading{Post-Condition (protocol)}
	\addnumberedsinglerow{PostP}{none}
